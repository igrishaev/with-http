## Installation

Lein:

```clojure
[com.github.igrishaev/with-http "0.1.0"]
```

Deps.edn

```clojure
{com.github.igrishaev/with-http {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}
```

Pay attention: since the library is mostly used for tests, put the dependency in
the corresponding profile or alias. Storing it in global dependencies is not a
good idea is it becomes a part of the production code.

## Why


## Usage

~~~clojure
(ns some.test-namespace
  (:require
   [clj-http.client :as client]
   [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]

~~~

~~~clojure
(deftest test-local-server

  (let [app
        {"/foo" {:get {:status 200
                       :body {:hello [1 "test" true]}}}}

        {:keys [status body]}
        (with-http [8080 app]
          (client/get "http://localhost:8080/foo" {:as :json}))]

    (is (= 200 status))
    (is (= {:hello [1 "test" true]} body))))
